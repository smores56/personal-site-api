# Personal Site API

The GraphQL API backend for my personal site,
[sam-mohr.com][personal site]. You can find the API hosted
at [api.sam-mohr.com][api].


## How it Works

My website hosts all of my movie (and TV show) reviews as well
as my recipes. Rather than storing them in a database like
[SQLite][sqlite], I wanted to store them in a human-readable format.
Thus, all of my records are stored in YAML files that are cloud-synced
between all of my personal machines and the server that this API
is hosted on using [MEGASync][megasync]. Per request, this API
parses every YAML file in each directory and serves them over a
JSON API, exposed with [GraphQL][graphql].

You can see the definitions for all exposed collections of data at the 
[GraphiQL][api graphiql] page for this API.


## Usage

You'll need [Rust installed][install rust] to run this API yourself.

To install it to your system, simply run the following:

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/smores56/personal-site-api
```

You can then run the API by providing a port to listen on and
(optionally nested) folders of reviews and recipes like so:

```console
$ personal-site-api --port=1234 --review-dir=reviews/ --recipe-dir=recipes/
```
